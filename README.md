# Secure Curves in the Web Cryptography API

This repository contains a proposal to add support for [Curve25519 and
Curve448](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748) in the Web Cryptography API.

There is an [explainer](./explainer.md) and a [draft specification](https://WICG.github.io/webcrypto-secure-curves/).

See the [implementation status](https://github.com/WICG/webcrypto-secure-curves/issues/20).

Acknowledgement: this proposal was based on [a previous proposal by Qingsi Wang
to include Curve25519 in WebCrypto](https://github.com/tQsW/webcrypto-curve25519).
